# NFA to DFA Conversion and String Generation

This repository contains code for converting a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the subset construction technique. It also includes functionality to generate a string that passes through all the states of the DFA.

## Problem Description

The problem is to detect all the strings from 0s and 1s such that the 4th symbol from the end is 1.
